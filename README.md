This is a small sample repository, showing how you to implement drag and drop folder upload in AspNetCore. The cool thing about this, is it scans the entire folder dragged and dropped and upload folders, subfolders and files. In the example it creates a similar file structure in the upload folder, as the user uploaded. But for your project you could upload the files to the cloud - AWS S3 or Azure block storage. You could create sub folders per user / customer. Whatever you want! This is more just to show the base logic for folder upload. I am not showing basic file upload, because there are plenty of examples of that out there on the internet. Below you can see a GIF showing the project.
